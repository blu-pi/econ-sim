# Final Year Project

This project requires python 3.10!
Make sure to pip install networkx and matplotlib! If there is another library you can't find due to an import error, pip install library_name!
Will make an executable for v1 release.

Ideally just install visual studio and select file -> open workspace from file -> select this folder (starting from project)
Demo video link is in submission but also here:
