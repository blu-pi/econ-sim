# Final Year Project

This project requires python 3.10 and (probably) won't run on linux due to file system differences. This can be run on windows!
Make sure to pip install networkx and matplotlib! If there is another library you can't find due to an import error, pip install library_name!

Ideally just install visual studio and select file -> open workspace from file -> select this folder (starting from project)
