First Diary entry. 
Testing git is working properly and adding basic file structure. Starting on base code.

Set up pytest, added line graph functionality. Testing Line graph functionality as well as constructors.
Can't get pytest to work so just use basic assert statements. Took ages for test module to be able to access program module so import errors were thrown. Fixed by moving test module into program module and messing with sys.path. This took soo long to fix
and I now hate anything to do with modules in python... Tests currently failing but I'm too exhausted to fix them right now. Will fix errors next.
