# Final Year Project
TO RUN SIMULATION, the popup graph image must be CLOSED. The simulation will not start while it is open!

This project requires python 3.10 or above!
Make sure to pip install networkx and matplotlib! If there is another library you can't find due to an import error, pip install library_name!
There are other libraries in use such as pandas, scipi etc. Just follow install instructions for those libs!

Ideally just install visual studio and select file -> open workspace from file -> select this folder (starting from project)
